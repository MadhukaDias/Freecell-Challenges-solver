the deck configuration is like this: 0000000000000000i8htd4sjs4d5dtsii4c5c6c5s8c9dkhiii7s1djd2cks1h4hivqc8s9h7dth7htcv6s3cqh2djh5hvikd1s3s6h9s6dvii7c1c2h9ckc2sviiiqd8d3dqs3hjc

When it comes to specify the challenge we have other than solve the deck like:
Clear a specific card or,
Clear 1 or more than one card from the same number (1,2,3,...,j,q,k)

Ex: Clear the King of Hearts, Clear the 7 of spades, Clear 3 Nines, Clear 4 Kings

And those challenges are with limited moves sometimes. Let's say we want to clear a specific card within 80 moves.

To get those information we need to edit the encoded string.

Use the separator '$' in the string like this.

encoded string: <deck configuration>$<challenge>$<number of moves>

deck configuration is already done.

In challenges, Let's the challenge is clear King of Hearts
So the string is "kh"
Let's say the challenge is clear 4 Nines
So the string is "94"

The first character says what is the number of the card (1,2,3,...,j,q,k)
Second character says;
    If it is a number, then we have to clear those number of cards from that type of card
    If it is a character (c,s,h,d), then we have to clear that specific card (Ex: kh, 9d, 1c)

If there is no specific challenge, the string will be "00" and which means solve the deck.

After that we want to identify the number of moves. The next string part will normaly a number.
If that number is 0, which means there is no limited moves.

Ex: Clear 9 of hearts
encoded string: 0000000000000000i8htd4sjs4d...jc$9h$0

Ex: Clear 2 Sevens
Encoded string: 0000000000000000i8htd4sjs4d...jc$72$0

Ex: Clear 7 of Diamonds no more than 76 moves
Encoded string: 0000000000000000i8htd4sjs4d...jc$7d$76

Ex: Clear 3 Kings no more than 65 moves
Encoded string: 0000000000000000i8htd4sjs4d...jc$k3$65
